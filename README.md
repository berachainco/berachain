Phase 1: Research & Preparation (Month 1-3)

✅ Market research and competitor analysis (Lido, Venus, PancakeSwap)
✅ Choosing the best tokenomics model (inflation rate, rewards, governance)
✅ Developing Whitepaper and Litepaper
✅ Building a strong team (developers, marketing, and community)
✅ Initial website and branding launch

Phase 2: Token Launch & Staking System (Month 4-6)

✅ Deploying the native token (BEP-20 standard)
✅ Developing smart contracts for staking (rewards, penalties, unstaking rules)
✅ Launching an initial staking dashboard for users
✅ Conducting an Airdrop campaign to attract early adopters
✅ Running a testnet version and gathering user feedback

Phase 3: Expanding Liquidity & Yield Farming (Month 7-9)

✅ Listing on decentralized exchanges (PancakeSwap, Biswap)
✅ Launching Liquidity Mining & Yield Farming pools
✅ Integrating auto-compounding rewards for higher APY
✅ Introducing LP staking incentives (stake LP tokens to earn extra rewards)
✅ Implementing a referral program to boost user adoption

Phase 4: Lending & DeFi Integrations (Month 10-12)

✅ Partnering with lending platforms like Venus for collateralized loans
✅ Introducing liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) for flexible staking
✅ Deploying a lending & borrowing system using staked assets
✅ Expanding to cross-chain staking via bridges to other chains
✅ Mobile app launch for staking management

Phase 5: Governance & Ecosystem Expansion (Month 12+)

✅ Launching DAO governance to decentralize decision-making
✅ Expanding staking support to multi-chain networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon)
✅ Creating incentives for developers to build on top of the protocol
✅ Introducing automated yield strategies for passive income
✅ Expanding partnerships with major BSC and DeFi projects

Key Features of the Project:

✔ Liquid Staking – Users can stake without locking their assets permanently
✔ Yield Farming & Auto-Compounding – Maximizing user rewards
✔ Lending & Borrowing Integration – Using staked assets as collateral
✔ DAO Governance – Community-driven decisions
✔ Cross-Chain Staking – Expanding to multiple blockchain networks

Final Thoughts:

This roadmap positions the project as a next-generation DeFi staking solution on BSC, combining staking, yield farming, lending, and governance. The focus on LSDs, cross-chain staking, and ecosystem partnerships ensures long-term sustainability and growth.
